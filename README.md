# Java-RescueAnimals
This is a school project in Java showcasing ability in creating classes with constructors, mutator and accessor methods, array list, loops, switch cases, etc..

# Summarize the project
This project is about creating animal rescue form through Java. First I defined classes for animals and then in a Driver.java I created an Array list, a loop with switch cases, and a menu. This form asks for information about the animal (either dog or monkey) through the menu that I created. In the medu you can select to intake new animal, reserve an animal, show a list of all animals, or a list of available animals. With help of the loops I was able to make the menu work as intended.

# Did you find writing any piece of the code challenging?
Java is a challenging language to learn and write in because it is long and includes a lot of writing. That was the most challenging part with syntax.

# What skills will be transferable to other projects?
The best skills I will transfer to other projects will be ability to work with syntax in Java, ability to create classes with constructors and other methods and creating loops or array lists.
